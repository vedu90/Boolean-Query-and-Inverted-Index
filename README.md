# Boolean-Query-and-Inverted-Index

We are given a Lucene Index generated  from the RCV2 multilingual news corpus. We need to retrieve all the fields and terms using JAVA and Lucene API's and then build a inverted postings List for all the terms. We are then given a set of queries from the vocabulary  and we need to perform the following boolean operations on those queries : 
1.Term at a time(TAAT) AND 
2.Term at a time(TAAT) OR
3.Document at a time (DAAT) AND
4.Doucment at a time(DAAT) OR
and post the results and number of comparisons.
